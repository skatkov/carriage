[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/carriage.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/carriage) 
# Carriage

Carriage is a Ruby wrapper to [Amazon Product Advertising API 5.0 - Cart Form](https://webservices.amazon.com/paapi5/documentation/add-to-cart-form.html). This gem helps add any number of items to a customer's shopping cart and sending him to Amazon website to complete his order. 

To use this gem, you need to have Amazon **AssociateTag**, so don't forget to [register first](https://webservices.amazon.com/paapi5/documentation/register-for-pa-api.html) with Amazon Associate program.

Programmatic access to product data is out of scope for this gem, but I recommend to use [vacuum gem](https://github.com/hakanensari/vacuum) if there is such a need.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'carriage'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install carriage
